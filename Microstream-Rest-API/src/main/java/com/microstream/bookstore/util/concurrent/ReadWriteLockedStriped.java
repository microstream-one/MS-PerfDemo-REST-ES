/**
 * Facility to execute operations with striped read and write locks.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, lock striping is the technique of dividing a lock into many stripes,
 * increasing the granularity of a single lock and allowing independent operations to lock
 * different stripes and proceed concurrently, instead of creating contention for a single lock.
 * <p>
 * Non-reentrant read operations are not allowed until all write operations of the affected stripe
 * have been finished.
 * Additionally, a write operation can acquire the read lock, but not vice-versa.
